	  <h1>About</h1>
	  <p>The purpose of the club is to encourage an active interest in coding and learning foundational computational skills! We can help students learn a wide variety of coding languages particularly Python and Java script as well as learn more about work happening in artificial intelligence, game design, and other applications of computer science. </p><br>
      <p> Additionally, there’s a focus on cybersecurity and supporting individual and team competitive sport experiences among students! The club endeavors to increase their knowledge of information security skills. Developing cybersecurity skills come as a part of Capture the Flag (CTF) events, learning “ethical hacking.” Members are committed to promoting the wider school community on information security and good computer security practices. </p>
