        <h1>Our Purpose</h1>
        <p>The purpose of the club is to encourage an active interest in coding and learning foundational computational skills. We can help students learn a wide variety of coding languages particularly Python and Java script as well as learn more about work happening in artificial intelligence and its various applications.</p>
        <p>Additionally, we focus on cybersecurity and support individual and team competitive sport experiences among students. The active membership of the club endeavors to increase their knowledge of information security skills. Developing cybersecurity skills may include, but are not limited to, Capture the Flag (CTF) events, simulated penetration testing labs, data forensics, incident response protocols, challenges, field trips, guest speakers, and seminars. Members are committed to promoting the wider school community on information security and good computer security practices.</p>
